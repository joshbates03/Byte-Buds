# Byte Buds

Byte Buds is a web application designed for classroom education, allowing teachers to assign programming challenges to students and monitor their submissions. Students can access an online coding environment to complete challenges and review submissions from their peers.

## Access Options

### Guest Access

Upon visiting [Byte Buds](https://bytebuds.co.uk), users are assigned a random username and can only attempt challenges and view submissions. This account type would ideally be used by students.
Below are some challenge codes you can try out in the challenge search bar:
- `k1544k`
- `mfra6h`
Additionally, public challenges are available on the homepage. Challenge submissions are only avaliable once the challenge has been completed.

### User Access

Users with an account have the ability to create groups and challenges. This account type would ideally be used by teachers.

To access these features, below are some details to log in as a registered user:
- `Username: examiner`
- `Password: examiner`
Once logged in you will be granted access to the features on the dashboard page, the `examiner` has a pre-made group, which holds the challenges assigned to the previously mentioned challenge codes.
